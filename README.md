# Nuking the World: A Doomsday Demo (Coded by a Syntax-Sabotaging Savant)

![Nuke Icon](nuke.png) *Click responsibly—or don't. We all die anyway.*

## 🚨 Project Warning
This is **not** a real nuke simulator. It's a silly, browser-based "explosion" toy where you click icons (nuke, TNT, grenade) to overlay dramatic images on a canvas and get sassy text updates judging your life choices. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS because frameworks are for cowards who fear raw DOM manipulation. (Spoiler: The dev *still* fears it—see the bug history below.)

If you're here to actually end the world: Wrong repo. Try therapy instead. If you're here for code laughs: Welcome, fellow masochist.

## 🎯 Features (That Actually Work, Miraculously)
- **Nuke Button**: Slaps an Earth-exploding WebP on the canvas. H1 taunts: "Damm you Exploded the earth in 2025 broo😮😱" (Yes, the typos are intentional—authenticity over orthography.)
- **TNT Icon**: Drops a GIF boom. H1 shade: "You fool why use granade use NUKE man 😮😒" (Grenade? It's TNT. Dev's naming scheme is "creative chaos.")
- **Grenade Launcher**: Pins a dud GIF. H1 roast: "You are not miltaay so do not use the granade man😑💣" (Military misspelled? Blame the coder's autocorrect allergy.)
- **One-Explosion Rule**: No image stacking—old booms get purged like yesterday's news. (Finally fixed after three iterations of "oops, Jenga tower.")
- **Responsive-ish Layout**: Flexbox magic for desktop. Mobile? Pray—it's 2025, but the dev's still on dial-up vibes.
- **Console Easter Eggs**: Click and check dev tools for victory logs like "You damm fool why did you did that??" (Grammar? Overrated.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Bare Minimum)
- **HTML5**: Structure so basic, even a caveman could grok it.
- **CSS3**: Gradients, flex, and hover scales. Aquamarine backgrounds? Aesthetic war crime.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Event listeners, DOM appends, and onload handlers. No React—because "state" is a four-letter word here.
- **Assets**: Local PNGs/GIFs/WebPs (nuke.png, tnt.png, granade.png, rotate.gif, explode-earth.webp, tnt-exp.gif, granade-exp.gif). Drop 'em in the repo root or watch 404s mock you.

## 📋 Installation & Run (For the Brave)
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nuking-the-world.git
   cd nuking-the-world
   ```
   (Replace with your actual repo URL, you lazy linker.)

2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari—Edge might nuke itself).  
   No build step—it's not fancy. Just drag-drop or `live-server` if you're paranoid about file paths.

3. Click icons in the picker sidebar. Watch the chaos canvas erupt. Refresh to reset (or add a button, dev—procrastinator).

4. Profit? Nah, just existential dread.

## 🐛 Known Bugs (A.K.A. The Dev's Hall of Shame)
- **Path Purgatory**: Local images? If they're not in the root, onload ghosts you. Upload to GitHub or cry.
- **Timing Ticks**: Explosions load fast—text swaps reliable now, but blame CORS if hosted weird.
- **Typo Terror**: "Granade"? "Miltaay"? "Damm"? Embraced as flavor text. Fork and fix if it offends your inner editor.
- **No Undo**: Once nuked, refresh to rebuild Earth. Add a reset? That's on you, apocalypse architect.
- **Mobile Mayhem**: Sidebar squishes—add media queries, you responsive rebel.

*Critique Corner*: This project started as a toddler's tantrum on a keyboard—syntax errors, self-appending imgs, Windows paths like "C:\Users\HP\Desktop\...". Evolved through roasts into... this. Dev: You're a glitchy genius. Keep coding; the world's ending anyway (in 2025, per the prophecy).

## 📸 Screenshots (Imagine These)
- **Idle**: Blue-gradient canvas with spinning GIF, sidebar icons begging for clicks.
- **Post-Nuke**: Fiery Earth overlay, h1 screaming in emoji horror.
- **TNT Tango**: Dusty GIF, h1 side-eyeing your choices.

(Add real ones via GitHub's image upload, slacker.)
